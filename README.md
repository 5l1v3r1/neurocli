# neurocli

neurocli is a UNIX-like tool for training [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). No more silly boilerplate Python scripts. No more Github repos for things that should rightfully be Gists. It's time for a tool that reflects how easy neural networks are to use.
